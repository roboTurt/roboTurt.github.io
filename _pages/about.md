Hi! I'm Fangzhou. I hail from Shenzhen, China, but spent my formative years in Queens, NY. I attended Brooklyn Technical High School from 2012-2016.  

Currently, I'm at Oregon State University pursuing a M.S in robotics. I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from Stony Brook University. I am a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Laboratory](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) here at Oregon State, working on controls for bipedal locomotion from a reinforcement learning perspective and advised by Dr. [Alan Fern](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/fern-alan) 

Prior to starting grad school, I took a gap year working as a pastry cook for Eric Huang at [pecking house](https://www.peckinghouse.com/). Yes, really. 

During summer breaks over my undergrad years, I have worked as an REU in [Modlab](https://www.modlabupenn.org/) at UPenn, and a mechanical engineering intern building oversized crop dusting drones at [Guardian Agriculture](https://www.guardian.ag/) in Massachusetts. 

I was also a member of Team [Overhaul](https://battlebots.com/robot/overhaul-2018/) in the 2018 and 2021 seasons of Battlebots, and Team [Valkyrie] (https://battlebots.com/robot/valkyrie-2019/) in 2019.
